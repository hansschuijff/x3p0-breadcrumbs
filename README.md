## Breadcrumbs Reimagined for a Modern, Block-Based WordPress

In 2009, I [launched the first version of this script](https://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/04/05/breadcrumb-trail-wordpress-plugin) as a WordPress plugin. And, honestly, I had built it and shipped it within my themes long before. It was called _Breadcrumb Trail_ back then.

Over the years, I continued refining the script. It was installed on hundreds of thousands (_millions?_) of websites as other theme authors packaged in their themes during this time.

Eventually, I shipped it as a standalone component named _Hybrid Breadcrumbs_. For some reason, most theme authors never caught on, their copies becoming more and more outdated. And I lost my motivation for keeping it updated for them.

One of the reasons that the script was so popular to bundle in themes was because users had no good way to add the plugin version to their sites without diving into code. Therefore, theme authors integrated it directly into their templates. That was simply the nature of classic WordPress.

But everything changed when WordPress launched the block editor and site editing feature (the block theme system).

With that change---and this new block plugin---users no longer need to rely on their theme author to keep the script updated. They can simply install this X3P0 - breadcrumbs and put the block wherever they want. Theme authors can still integrate with it, but they no longer have to worry about maintaining an updated codebase for their breadcrumbs.

Today, this breadcrumbs script is finally what it was always meant to be. It took 14 years or so for it to become a reality, but we're finally here.
